How I wonder what you are!
Up above the world so high,
Like a diamond in the sky.

Twinkle, twinkle, shining bright,
Guiding travelers through the night.
In the dark, you glow and gleam,
Whispering wishes, chasing dreams.

Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
Always watching from afar.
In your light, we find our way,
Bringing hope to night and day. Hello""")
